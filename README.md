# Budge It
## Description
- Envelope-based buget system
- I'm making this app for fun

## Envelope-Based Budget Hierachy
- Income Sources (or "Sources") are ways that you accept income (example: Paychecks)
- You "Allocate" parts of your "Sources" into "Accounts" (example of an account: Savings)
- Your "Accounts" get "Distributed" amongst "Envelopes" (example of an envelope: House Down Payment)
